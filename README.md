# Data Science Portfolio

-This repository contains my projects for my introductory data science class at the University of Notre Dame. 

-Folders labeled "Week __" indicate in-class coding practice, where I learn new tools and methods.

-The first major project is the Basic_streamlit_app, in which I explored data visualization with Streamlit.
